I made this project for my Future Ready Talent internship in Microsoft Azure.

1. INDUSTRY : Financial Technology


2. PROJECT TITLE : Website with AI Chatbot using Microsoft Azure Services


3. PROBLEM STATEMENT/OPPORTUNITY: 

	The management of a business organisation has observed that in this day and age, the online presence of an 
    organization regardless of industry can have a massive impact on its success. The most important tool that 
    you have to market your work is a portfolio website. With a portfolio website, potential clients from around 
    the world can review the  products and understand the services at their convenience. A well-crafted portfolio
    of unique projects, impactful campaigns and demonstrated achievements offers organisations a great opportunity 
    to differentiate their brand. Following the best practices, the organisation can improve online visibility and 
    cultivate credibility to capture the interest of B2B clients.

	There are three main goals of a successful portfolio website. First, it will help present your work in the best 
    possible way while marketing and explaining your services in a clear manner. Second, the website will enable you 
    to get to know your customers and site visitors. And third, it will act as a hub for all of your online and	offline 
    marketing activities. We can explore the benefits of each of these three things in greater detail:

	ATTRACT THE RIGHT CLIENTS:

	With the right product selection, branding and marketing message, the ideal clients can visit the organisation 
    portfolio website and feel at home. The ideal client will immediately recognize themselves in your description, 
    clearly understand your services and feel confident that you are the perfect for their business. Most clients are 
    not looking for a faceless and nameless brand to develop patterns and to prepare work for production. Most clients 
    are looking for a partner they can trust and work with for years to come.

	KNOW YOUR CUSTOMERS:

	One of the key benefits of having a portfolio website is that it allows you to have more direct contact with potential 
    clients and visitors to your site. Free tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see where your website visitors are 
    coming from, how they are finding you, and what parts of your website they are spending the most time on.

	YOUR MARKETING HUB:
	
    With so many different ways to sell and market product and services including online networks and physical networks,
	it is imperative to make your website your marketing hub, the one place potential clients can go to learn more about 
    product and services whether online or offline. The portfolio website provides an opportunity to explain your business 
    model and services. Furthermore, potential clients can find all the social media links they may need on your website.

	MAKE SURE YOU ARE MAXIMIZING YOUR POTENTIAL:

	A portfolio website is so much more than a website where you present your work. The website is a channel to explain 
    about achievements and welcome new contacts and clients to your client base. The website design should consider how the 
    organisation can develop a more inviting environment to new clients, clearly explain product and services. Itâ€™s a great 
    business building strategy and wonderful way to develop long lasting relationships with clients.


4. PROJECT DESCRIPTION*:	

	The aim of the project is to create a business portfolio website with an artificial intelligence chatbot to make online 
    presence of the organisation. It will provide clients an easy and convenient user interface for asking queries regarding 
    the product and services. The conversation with the customers visiting the website with the help of AI Chatbot will increase 
    the positive user experience towards the organisation. The chatbot will add convenience for customers visiting the website. 
    The chatbot will help customers to get all the information required as quickly and smoothly as possible. The chatbot will 
    guide the customers find their way in and out of the website information. Chatbots will act like website assistants. The 
    management have selected Azure Cloud Services to create the Chatbot. The website will have a Home page, About page, Product 
    details Page, Gallery Page and Contact Page along with FAQ chatbot deployed for customers help. The chatbot is placed at
    the bottom right corner of all the web pages of the website. Some of the advantages of using the chatbot are as follows :

    	1. Faster and efficient method to provide information to the customers. 
    
    	2. Exceptionally fast exchange of customer problems and solutions.

    	3. Easy and least time consuming.
